# Week 12 - Using d3.js

For this week's assignment, I wanted to use a library that I hadn't before, and the viusalization elements that came with d3.js really intrigued me. There is not much to talk about within the actual process since what I created is rather simple and implements my main understandings of the library. My assignemtn simple displays a bar chart based off of 4 data inputs that I wrote. The bar graph accurately describes the values of my data through the height of the bar. The only thing that I have not implemented, is a label. Right now, the screen just has 4 bars, but no way of indicating what bar represents what piece of information.

I was able to get a basic understanding/grasp of d3.js through two main things:

1) The ewbsite's documentation -- used it as a foundation for my project, where I simply implemented some of the examples provided on the website
2) To further broaden my understanding, I decided to delve into some youtube videos, and from there I was able to build & expand on my assignment even more.
