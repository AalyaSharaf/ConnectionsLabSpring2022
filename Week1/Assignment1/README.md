## Project Idea

### Turning the Auditory into Visual

Last Fall, I took a class called A.rt I.ntel with Professor Michael Ang. In this class, we were able to explore machine learning & Artificial Intelligence and how they they affect our day-to-day lives, whether we concsiusly realize it or not. With the visual project in particular, I was able to use a Google Collab that transforms text prompts into Art.

My idea relied on music. The first thought that came to mind was the differnt genres of music. Normally, when listening to a song, you are able to identify and distinguish the category, or genre, that a song falls into based solely off of the melody, or the sounds that we hear in general. What would happen if something auditory was turned visual? Would the distinction be as instictual? I was able to input song lyrics and titles from different genres and the results were extraordinary!

## Wireframing / Website Development

(insert wireframe images)

This was the general idea for my project. I knew I wanted a single scroll... I also wanted it to be extremely simple, hence the minimal amount of text on the first page. When it came to the actual website development, I broke it down into a few steps:

1. First, I just began with creating the structure of the website with some html. The main challenge was to make sure that each of the sections (home, about, and gallery) had a block of its own. I wanted to make sure that each had its fixed place.
2. Next, I picked a color scheme... like I mentioned I kenw I wanted my first page to be simple, but I also wanted it to stand out which is why I made it a different, and darker color... to create an accent. 
3. To be completely honest, the thing I struggled with the most when creating this website, was the CSS aspect of it, more specifically content positioning. I had a specific vision of how I wanted the elements of the webpage to be, and implementing, or rather coding it, was rather frustrating at times. Specifically when you intend for the code to do one thing, but then it does something else... Regardless, I was able to figure it out, and with a lot of trial and error, I was able to style the page the way I had envisioned. 
4. Finally, for the gallery part of my project, I did not know what the most effecient way to present the images wuld be. Initially, when presenting my orignial project, I created a game of sorts... I displayed the images as cards/icons (using js) and had the class gues what category or genre (out of the 4 mentioned above) each of the images fell into. Once you click on the image, the answer is revealed on the back, and the name of the song and its singer are also mentioned. I did not want to repeat the same thing with this project so I opted for a simple and neat "table" of sorts. I wanted to be able to display as much of the images as I wanted, and I wanted the art to be the statement...
