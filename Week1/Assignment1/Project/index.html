            <p class="container_about-text">As we know, music comes in many different forms. You hear a song, and there is this immediate classification or differentiation that you make in your head. A classical piece sounds extremely different to a country one. Our brains have been wired to understand and iterpret the differences between them, but what happens when we take what is auditory and turn it into something visual? Will out brain still be able to distinguish as easily?</p> <br>
            <p class="container_about-text">Using machine learning and AI, I was able to put over 60 prompt and song titles into a google collab prompt and watched what unfolded before me. These songs fell under 4 main categories: Arabic, Classical, Disney, and Rock. There are 3 main things I wanted to explore with this project. The first is whether the songs titles that fall under the same category will develop images that could be identifiable as "falling uder the same group". How similar or different will the results be? Along the same lines, my second point was to compare images of songs from different genres and see if anything overlaps. Finally, I wanted to explore whether or not the brain would be able to go beyond the auditory realm, and use the distinguishing features of the visual realm to make distinctions it ways it may not typically be used to. Would an image be enough to know what genre a song is? </p>
