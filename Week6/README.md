# Homeword - Node Implimentation

## Coding Process

For this week's assignment, my intention was to create an API for guitar brands and have a user be able to search for a specific brand through a text box. 

### Creating API

This part of the project was rather straightforward, since we had worked with text files and APIs before. All I did was go through a few guitar brands - I mentioned the year that they were founded, who their founder is, and where their shipping area is. 

### Using "index.js" (Back-End)

I will admit, that the back-end of the server, meaning mostly what we discussed and worked on during class was really difficult for me. I am still trying my best to understand it. That is why, I wanted this homework assignment to work as a way for me to practice these skills. With that being said, I was not able to achieve the result I had wanted to with this project, meaning it does not work the way I wished it to. 

To go over what I did, I made sure that my information was fetched in my index.js file (this is all after I installed the node modules I needed). I made it so the server did 2 main things. First, when going into the localhost:3000/guitars, my list would appear on the screen. Also, when you specifiy the name of the guitar brand in the folllowing format: localhost/guitars/guitarName, it would give you specific information to the brand you just referred to. Second, I made it so that you can filter the guitar brands based on the year that it was founded. This is done through the following format: localhost/guitar?yearFOunded=(enter year). This way, when you input a specific year, all guitar companies that were founded before that time, will not appear on the screen.

### Using "app.js" (Front-End)

This part I struggled with quite a lot. I feel like I had just began to wrap my head around javascript and how to make that work, so with the added element of being responsible for your own server, I just find out too compolicated. I spent countless hours trying to make the project work, but I judt did not know how to go about it. 

My intention with this project was to have:
1. The input box be used to search for a guitar company
2. The query be used to filter the year that it was founded.

While I was able to complete the second task, the first one proved to be too difficult. It is a bit frustrating because I feel like the answer or even the way in which I can do this is pretty, straightforward, I am just not able to get it. I am even struggling with how to google in general... I tried to research with the hope of resolving my issue on my own, but again cam up empty.

## Final Thoughts

Regardless of all the issues I ran into with this assignment, I am glad that I was able to step out of my comfort zone. I may not have finished with the results I wanted, but I am glad that I was able to somewhat get a grasp on the main concepts that we covered in class... I look forward to our next class, hopefully that will help me troubleshoot and finally figure out my own code.
