# Project 2 - Pirate Game

## Project Link & Code

[Here](https://beautiful-strengthened-menu.glitch.me) is the link to access my project, and [here](https://github.com/AalyaSharaf/CL-Project2-PirateGame) is a link to the Github page where my code is uploaded.

For the glitch website, for some reason it would not allow me to change project name -- mentioned an "internal server error", so I apologize that the project name is not accurate there.

## Documentation

[Here](https://github.com/AalyaSharaf/ConnectionsLabSpring2022/blob/main/Project%202/Project2Documentation.pdf) is a link the my documentation in pdf form. It is also uploaded to this repository under the title "Project2Documentation.pdf".

Please email me if the link does not seem to be working for some reason, and I will be quick to respond!
