# Project 1 - Documentation

The link below should allow you to access a pdf version of my documentation (done using notion)!

[Project_1_Documentation.pdf](https://github.com/AalyaSharaf/ConnectionsLabSpring2022/files/8148197/Project_1_Documentation.pdf)

If this does not work, then [here]() is a markdown version of the notion page I exported. I have never exported a notion page like this, so the layout is a bit messy compared to the pdf!
