## Project Idea

For this project, I wanted to keep it simple and make sure that I was just able to understand the main concepts of socket.io. I decided that creating a chat app would be the most convenient, and would also be the most effective way to test my knowledge. The way it works is simple, one user sends a message, and the output would appear on everybody else's screen but their own. The same works for recieving a message from another user. 

## Coding Process

I broke down my coding process into 3 parts:

1) Using the in class demo, I began with making sure that the javascript, on both the client and server side, worked properly. I was able to do this by going over the class notes as well as the recording to gain a firmer grasp of teh content that was being presented. Once I was able to fully understand the code, I found that it was not too difficult to manipulate it and form it into what I wanted. That means that instead of it being a drawing app, I was able to modify a few things to turn it into a chat app.
2) Next, I worked on making sure my html file was organized that way I could style the page.
3) Finally, I found that styling the page is what brought everything together. In step 1, the app was working great, but the look of it was not the best, so I felt that it was important to style the page as a final step!

## Difficulties

There are some difficulties I ran into when working on this project, most of them having to do with my understanding, or rather misunderstanding, of the content. With that being said, there is one thing I was not able to achieve. At the moment, the app will only display a message on the screens of other clients on the server, but not on your own (meaning the message that you sent will not be displayed on your screen). That was something that I tried to fix but was unable to. It is rather frustrating since I feel that would have completed the expeience for he user... Second, the way that the app is working currently, is that once somebody sends a chat, thenany previous chat history / messages are overridden. I feel like having the added element of the content still remaining there would have also been really nice, but that was also something that I was unable to achieve. Overall, I am extremely happy with the way that this application turned out!
